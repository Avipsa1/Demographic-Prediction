# Demographic-Prediction-from-Location

 Demographic information plays a very significant role in targeting online advertisements
 and personalised marketing to focused user groups by gaining insights about user’s mobility patterns.
 This in turn can help organizations to make informed and strategic decisions about their online
 marketing strategies.  However, in practice, demographic information such as age and gender are
 mostly unavailable to app developers for open access due to privacy concerns.
This work as part of the paper "A Machine Learning Approach to Demographic Prediction from Geohashes",
we try to address the gap of how to enrich anonymised location data by predicting the user’s demographics.

This information could be extremely valuable for app developers and online advertisers.
Hence, we devise an algorithm to predict the age groups and gender of users from anonymised GPS locations
along with app usage information.  In our study, we combining a number of approaches such as -frequent
pattern mining, linear discriminant analysis and decision tree classification to predict user’s age and
gender from their GPS locations.
